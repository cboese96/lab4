For this assignment, you will write JavaScript code for the four exercises listed below. 
When finished, you should submit your solutions (one JavaScript (.js) file per solution) *my lab instructor said one html is fine*
to this assignment.  Be sure to document your work with comments for code management. 

For each problem, you should first describe your solution in English - as a set of JavaScript comments. 
Once you have written down how you will solve the problem, THEN you will write the code. Submissions 
without a "plan" will not receive full credit.

Exercise 1 - Display a Triangle
Write a loop that makes seven calls to output the following triangle:

Exercise 2 - FizzBuzz
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. 
For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.

Exercise 3 - Modify FizzBuzz
Modify the FizzBuzz program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 
(and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by 3 or 5, respectfully.)

Exercise 4 - Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an NÃ—N grid, using newline characters to separate lines. 
At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard. 
(Output should show something like the image below.)  Prompt for a value so that the program works for any size, 
outputting a grid of the given width and height.
